**DrumLib** is a self-developed web application created out of a passion for music, drumming, and backend development. It allows users to explore profiles of legendary drummers, browse their discographies, and listen to related tracks using a built-in custom audio player.

The project also includes social features such as user registration, login, profile editing, and the ability to comment and suggest new content.
